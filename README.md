# Tufte in Python

Gradually-expanding plotting library taking aesthetic inspiration from Edward Tufte, cloned from [here](https://github.com/juanshishido/tufte). Built on top of Matplotlib but hopefully less eye-gougingly ugly and painful to work with.

Packaged with the webfont version of the typeface used in Edward Tufteâ€™s books, taken from [this repo](https://github.com/edwardtufte/et-book). Regular, bold and italic variants are included; all should be installed before using the library.
